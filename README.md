# NotesApp

This is a simple Notes app that I was created to develop programming skills. 
It's coded in pure JS, HTML, CSS without any libraries used.
It has some interesting features like a dynamic colour generator, an animated 'create new note' button, saving and deleting notes from the browser's local storage and a fully responsive design.
